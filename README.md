 **Overview of the Analysis**
 
    The purpose of this analysis is to use the skill we developed through the class to create ways of displaying data so that you can display your information to others. This process in Python is called matplotlib, which we use in Jupyter notebook in order to create graphs to show data in very creative ways. The company task us to use the data so that we can show that data to our clients. I have created scatter charts, pie charts, and etc. We use different charts to display that data in different ways.
   
**Results**

  The data showed so much Pyber will find useful in the three city types percentages of fares and the main profit drivers for the company. They also found they have the most drivers in those urban areas. The cost per ride is higher in the other city types. The line graph showed less fares in rural areas.

**Summary**

  I recommend that you try get more drivers in your urban market in order increase the fares there. I would also raise the fares in rural or suburban areas so that price per fare increases and may generate more revenue. Lastly, I would look for opportunities to grow the suburban market at the risk of losing our rural markets.
